This application enables users to construct a maze by interacting with buttons. Users select a starting "cell" and a destination 'cell,' and click on empty cells to create 'walls.' The maze is solved by clicking a 'SOLVE' button, which entails finding a path from the start cell to the destination cell, if such a path exists.
